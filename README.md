# Hurricane

Hurricane Robot Control System for SJTU RoboMaster Competition

This project is generated with STM32CubeMX and built with CMake.

This project requires [CAHRR](https://github.com/SkyZH/CAHRR).

## Structure

All directory except Src-CAH are generated by STM32CubeMX.

`Src/runtime` contains Dajiang official code.

We've made changes to `Src/stm32f4xx_it.c` and `main.c`, to redirect interrupts to Hurricane system and bootstrap the Hurricane control system.

### Systems

* HurricaneArmSystem - control two arms of our robot
* HurricaneCANSystem - control CAN devices
* HurricaneChassisSystem - control chassis
* HurricaneClawSystem - control claw, which is built with potentiometer and pwm motor
* HurricaneCollectorSystem - control ball collector, which is built with servo
* HurricaneDebugSystem - transmit debug information
* HurricaneGPIOSystem - process GPIO interrupts
* HurricaneIMUSystem - get gyro data
* HurricaneRemoteSystem - get data from Dajiang joystick
* HurricaneUltrasonicSystem - get data from ultrasonic sensors
